### How to play

* You are presented with a board of squares.<br />
* Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.<br />
* Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.<br />
* To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think is a bomb, point and right-click to place a flag.<br />
* Select 'Reset' to restart the game.<br />
* Select 'Help' for more information on playing the game.
